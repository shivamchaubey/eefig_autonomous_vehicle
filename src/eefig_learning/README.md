Q&A for Yuri:
- How does tracker C and tracker m work? Why not calculate the ellipse (covariance and medium) directly with last samples?
- Is counter and idx in Granule the same?
- Explain what is force_update meant to do. In the current situation force_update prevents the update of the granule after the stability period is reached
- What is the diference between online and offline learning? It seems very similar and unecesary to divide
- Explain WLS and RLS

Q&A for Vicen√ß / Eugenio / Shivam:
- Basics on how the simulation works
